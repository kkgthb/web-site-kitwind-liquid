# Kitwind, but with data behind it

Kitwind's free "Kometa UI" Tailwind CSS components are awesome, but the samples are a little hard to think about as a data model.

Fixing that -- have a look at [the input data](https://github.com/kkgthb/web-site-kitwind-liquid/blob/main/src/computed_pseudo_pages/singleton_home.liquid) and [the output web site](https://kitwind-liquid.netlify.app/).

Made with 11ty, Tailwind JIT, and the Liquid templating language.
